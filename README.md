   <strong>Programmer's Starter Blog</strong>
</h1>

When I first started off as a programmer, I didn't know that I would one day need to have a portfolio to showcase my work. I have made three iterations of the same website (this being the third) of which the first two sucked. And then I discovered React.js and shortly after, I discovered Gatsby.js and thus, the rest is history.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is not for beginners in Web Development.

Prerequisite knowledge:

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Materialize CSS (Not really needed)
- React.js (Specifically Gatsby.js)
- GraphQL
- Yaml

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Create a repo of this site.**

    You can do this either by cloning the repo or downloading the zip folder

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the blog starter
    git clone https://github.com/MaxwellKJr/mjcodes.git
    ```

2.  **Install Dependecies.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and run npm install or yarn install

    ```shell
    cd mjcodes/

    # npm
    $ npm install

    # yarn
    $ yarn install
    ```

3.  **Start the development server.**

    ```shell
    $ gatsby develop

    # Output
    You can now view programmers-starter-blog in the browser.

    http://localhost:8000/

    View GraphiQL, an in-browser IDE, to explore your site's data and schema

    http://localhost:8000/___graphql

    Note that the development build is not optimized.
    To create a production build, use gatsby build
    ```

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

4.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Open the folder using your favorite text editor (for web development) and start coding. Start by editing the `src/pages/index.js` file,save the changes and the browser will update in real time!

    _**NOTE: Keep the server running.**_

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

5.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

6.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

7.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

8.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

9.  **`LICENSE`**: This Gatsby starter is licensed under the 0BSD license. This means that you can see this file as a placeholder and replace it with your own license.

10. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

11. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

12. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

## 🎓 Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.
