  dedicated "mobile" web versions? If you can't remember I dare you to go visit
  them. Don't get me wrong, they are MUCH better than they were in 2014 thanks
  to a lot web technologies that have emerged along the way. But this is about
  why mobile development is just better.

The world has witnessed a massive technological advancement in recent times, and mobile devices have become a major part of this advancement. With the increasing number of mobile devices, the demand for mobile apps has also increased exponentially. This has resulted in a significant rise in the field of web development, specifically mobile development.

Mobile development refers to the process of creating applications that run on mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets, and even smartwatches. Mobile development has several benefits, both from the app user's perspective and the developer's perspective. In this article, we will discuss the advantages of mobile development from both perspectives.

#### Advantages of Mobile Development (App Perspective)

##### 1. Better Performance += Better User Experience

One of the most significant benefits of mobile development is better performance, which leads to better user experience. Mobile apps are specifically designed to run on mobile devices, and they are optimized for performance. This means that mobile apps run smoothly, are faster, and provide a better user experience compared to web applications.

##### 2. Accessibility

Mobile apps are accessible anytime and anywhere, as long as you have an internet connection. This makes mobile apps more convenient to use compared to web applications. Mobile apps can be downloaded and installed on your device, and once installed, they can be accessed with just a single tap.

##### 3. Ease-of-use (Depends on the app really)

Mobile apps are designed with a user-friendly interface, making them easy to use. They are designed to be intuitive, with minimal user input required to operate them. This makes mobile apps a great choice for users who are not tech-savvy or have limited experience with technology.

##### 4. Take Advantage of Hardware Resources

Mobile apps can take advantage of the hardware resources of a mobile device, such as the camera, GPS, and accelerometer. This allows mobile apps to provide a better user experience compared to web applications. For example, a camera app can take photos, edit them, and share them on social media directly from your device.

#### Advantages of Mobile Development (Developer's Perspective)

##### 1. High Industry Demand for Mobile Developers

There is a high demand for mobile developers in the software development industry. This demand is due to the increasing popularity of mobile devices and the need for mobile apps. Mobile developers are responsible for designing and developing mobile apps for various platforms such as iOS and Android.

##### 2. Better Salaries (Mostly but not always)

Mobile developers are paid well due to the high demand for their services. The average salary for a mobile developer is higher than the average salary for a web developer. However, this may vary based on the experience and skill level of the developer and even location.

##### 3. Easy to Monetize Apps

Mobile apps are easy to monetize compared to web applications. Mobile apps can be monetized through various means such as in-app purchases, advertisements, and subscriptions. This makes mobile apps a lucrative business for developers.

##### 4. Narrower Manageable Technologies

Mobile development has a narrower scope compared to web development. This makes it easier for developers to manage and master the technologies required for mobile development. The technologies used for mobile development are specific to the platform, such as iOS or Android, which makes it easier for developers to focus on a specific set of skills. Even hybrid choices such as React Native and Flutter are easy to focus on and specialize.

This is nothing compared to the options that web development offers. The JavaScript libraries, frameworks, and packages alone are overwhelming.

#### Conclusion

Mobile development has several advantages, both from the app user's perspective and the developer's perspective. Mobile apps provide a better user experience, are accessible anytime and anywhere, and can take advantage of the hardware resources of a mobile device. Mobile development is also a lucrative business, with high demand for mobile developers and easy monetization of apps. Additionally, the narrower scope of mobile development makes it easier for developers to manage and master the required technologies. Overall, mobile development is a promising field with a bright future.
